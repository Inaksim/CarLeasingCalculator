# Car Leasing Calculator

## Overview

This React application is a car leasing calculator that allows users to calculate the total leasing cost, down payment, monthly installment, and interest rate based on user inputs such as car type, car value, lease period, and down payment percentage. The application is designed to be responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Approach to the Solution

The approach taken for this solution involves creating a responsive React application with the following key components:

- **State Management**: Using React's useState hook to manage input values and calculated results.
- **Dynamic Calculation**: Implementing functions to dynamically calculate leasing details based on user inputs.
- **User Interface**: Designing a responsive UI using CSS, with sliders and input fields for user inputs and real-time display of calculated results.

## Features

- Dynamic calculation of leasing costs based on user inputs.
- Real-time updates of the leasing details as the user changes inputs.
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile views.
- User input validation to prevent invalid entries.
